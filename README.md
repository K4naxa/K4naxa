### Hi there 👋

I'm Jami, a Full Stack Engineer based in Finland.

I am passionate about tinkering and transforming my ideas into reality. Whether it's fixing a washing machine or troubleshooting a projector, I enjoy exploring challenges to learn something new.

When inspiration strikes, I dive right into building it.

My primary tech stack includes Vue, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and sometimes Laravel with PHP. I also love using Figma and Notion as my go-to tools.

Feel free to check out my pinned projects below or visit [my website](https://k4studio.dev) to see more of my work.
